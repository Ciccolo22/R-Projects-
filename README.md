##### RMD file stores a basic web app I've been tinkering with... Nothing production ready, more experimenting with Flexdashboard and Shiny Frameworks.... Exploratory Linear Regression app using jtools and visreg can be found  https://ciccolo22.shinyapps.io/mtcarstry2/.. Still much to learn with FlexDashboard and Shiny, but glad I could get this up running.
